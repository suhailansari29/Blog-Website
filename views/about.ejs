    Welcome to my personal blogging website â€” a space where thoughts meet technology.
        <br>
    This platform is built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) to deliver a seamless, dynamic blogging experience. Whether you're here to read, reflect, or write, the site is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use.

    From crafting posts to rendering pages dynamically, everything is handled through server-side logic using Express and EJS templating. This ensures a clean, maintainable structure behind the scenes and a user-friendly interface up front.

    Whether you're a fellow developer or a curious reader, I hope you enjoy exploring this blog as much as I enjoyed building it.
